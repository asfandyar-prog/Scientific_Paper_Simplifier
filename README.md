🧠 Scientific Paper Simplifier

Transform complex scientific papers into easy-to-read summaries using NLP and Transformer models.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simplify dense academic research papers into clear, concise summaries. It aims to make scientific knowledge more accessible to students, researchers, and the general public — bridging the gap between academic writing and practical understanding.

🚀 Project Overview

Scientific research papers are often filled with complex technical language that can be challenging for non-experts.
This project uses Transformer-based models (e.g., BART, T5) to generate simplified, human-readable summaries that retain key insights and meaning.

✨ Key Features

Automated Text Simplification: Converts complex text into a simpler, easier form.

Transformer-Based Summarization: Uses pre-trained Hugging Face models for high-quality results.

Section-Wise Simplification: Works on individual paper sections such as Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion.

Interactive Notebook Workflow: Built entirely in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch / TensorFlow (backend for model execution)

NLTK / SpaCy (tokenization + preprocessing)

Pandas & NumPy (data handling)

git clone https://github.com/asfandyar-prog/Scientific_Paper_Simplifier.git
cd Scientific_Paper_Simplifier
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you’re running the notebook in Google Colab, you can skip installation — required libraries will auto-install within the notebook cells.

🧠 How It Works

Text Extraction: Input a scientific paragraph or full section from a research paper.

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and sentence segmentation.

Simplification Model: The text is passed through a Transformer model (e.g., T5 or BART) fine-tuned for summarization/simplification.

Output Generation: A simplified summary that preserves meaning but reduces jargon and complexity.

📊 Example

Input:

“The convolutional neural network architecture has demonstrated remarkable success in visual recognition tasks; however, its interpretability remains a significant challenge.”

Simplified Output:

“CNNs work very well for image recognition, but they are still hard to understand.”

🎯 Goals & Impact

This project demonstrates how AI can democratize access to science by making complex research easier to understand. It also showcases:

Applied NLP skills (transformers, tokenization, inference)

Research translation for real-world impact

Project management and open-source best practices

📈 Future Improvements

Fine-tune the model on domain-specific corpora (e.g., biomedical papers)

Add a web interface using Streamlit or Gradio

Enable multi-language support for non-English papers
